# AWS DevOps CI/CD Project

Welcome to the AWS DevOps CI/CD Project repository. This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building, deploying, and managing cloud-native applications using AWS services and DevOps best practices. The repository is designed to help you understand both the technical architecture and the workflow required for modern cloud deployments.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a hands-on blueprint for implementing CI/CD pipelines using AWS. It covers the automation of build, test, and deployment processes, enabling rapid and reliable delivery of applications.

The main goals are:
- Automate application deployment on AWS infrastructure.
- Ensure code quality and security through automated testing.
- Demonstrate infrastructure as code (IaC) principles.
- Support scalable, maintainable cloud architecture.

## Architecture

The architecture leverages multiple AWS services to form a robust, secure, and scalable system. Here’s an overview of the typical components:

1. **Source Control (GitHub):**
   - All code and configuration are versioned in this repository.

2. **Continuous Integration (CI):**
   - Triggered on code changes (pull requests, merges).
   - Uses AWS CodeBuild or GitHub Actions for compiling, running tests, and packaging applications.

3. **Artifact Storage:**
   - Build artifacts are stored in Amazon S3 or AWS CodeArtifact for further stages.

4. **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
   - AWS CodeDeploy or AWS Elastic Beanstalk automates deployment to target environments (e.g., EC2, Lambda, ECS).
   - Rollbacks are managed automatically in case of failures.

5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
   - AWS CloudFormation or Terraform templates provision infrastructure, ensuring repeatability and version control.

6. **Monitoring & Logging:**
   - AWS CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray collect logs and metrics for visibility into application health and performance.

**Typical Flow:**

```
Developer → GitHub → CI (CodeBuild/GitHub Actions) → Artifact Storage (S3/CodeArtifact) 
→ CD (CodeDeploy/Elastic Beanstalk) → AWS Infrastructure → Monitoring (CloudWatch/X-Ray)
```

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Services:** EC2, S3, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, CloudWatch, IAM, Lambda (if serverless)
- **DevOps Tools:** GitHub Actions, Terraform (optional), Docker (optional)
- **Programming Languages:** (List main languages used in the repo, e.g., Python, Node.js, etc.)

## CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

1. **Source Push:** Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2. **Automated Build:** Triggered workflow runs automated tests and builds application.
3. **Artifact Creation:** Application package is uploaded to S3/CodeArtifact.
4. **Automated Deployment:** CodeDeploy/Elastic Beanstalk deploys to AWS environment.
5. **Monitoring:** CloudWatch tracks health and sends alerts if issues arise.
6. **Rollback:** Automatic if deployment errors are detected.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lahda/AWS-DevOps-CICD-Project-main.git
   cd AWS-DevOps-CICD-Project-main
   ```
2. **Review the `docs/` folder** for detailed instructions on setting up AWS services and configuring pipelines.
3. **Deploy Infrastructure:**
   - Use provided CloudFormation or Terraform templates (see `infrastructure/` directory).
4. **Configure CI/CD:**
   - Update pipeline configuration files with your AWS credentials and environment specifics.
